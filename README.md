# Methods
This is a template for the Methods section of a scientific publication and is intended to serve as a starting point. Only retain paragraphs relevant to your analysis. References [ref] to the respective publications are curated in the software table above. Versions (ver) have to be read out from the respective conda environment specifications (.yaml file) or post execution. Parameters that have to be adapted depending on the data or workflow configurations are denoted in squared brackets e.g. [X].

The outlined analyses were performed using the programming languages R (ver) [ref] and Python (ver) [ref] unless stated otherwise. We applied both linear and non-linear unsupervised analysis methods for dimensionality reduction on normalized data for downstream analyses (e.g., clustering) and to visualize emerging patterns in lower dimensional embeddings.

**Dimensionality Reduction**

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [ref] from scikit-learn (ver) [ref] as the linear approach with the solver [svd_solver]. We visualized [dimensions] principal components and kept [n_components/all] components for downstream analyses. For diagnostic purposes we visualized the variance explained of all and the top 10% of principal components (PCs) using elbow- and cumulative-variance-plots, sequential pair-wise PCs for up to 10 PCs using scatter-, and density-plots (colored by [metadata_of_interest]), and finally loadings plots showing the magnitude and direction of the 10 most influential features for each PC as lollipop plot and biplot for sequential combinations of PCs. The R packages ggally (ver) [ref] and ggrepel (ver) [ref] were used to improve the diagnostic visualizations.

**Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)**
Uniform Manifold Approximation projection (UMAP) from umap-learn (ver) [ref] was used as the non-linear approach. The metric [metric] and number of neighbors [n_neighbors] were used for the generation of a shared k-nearest-neighbor graph. The graph was embedded in [n_components] dimensions with minimum distance parameter [min_dist].
(Optional) We used the density preserving regularization option, densMAP [ref], during the embedding step, with default parameters to account for varying local density of the data within its original high dimensional space.

**Hierarchically Clustered Heatmap**
Hierarchically clustered heatmaps of scaled data (z-score) were generated using the Python package scipy's (ver) [ref] function pdist for distance matrix calculation (for observation and features), fastcluster's R implementation (ver) [ref] for hierarchical clustering and the R package ComplexHeatmap (ver) [ref] for visualization. (optional) To reduce computational cost the observations were downsampled to [heatmap:n_observations] and top [n_features] features selected by high variance. The distance metric [metric] and clustering method [clustering_method] were used to determine the hierarchical clustering of observations (rows) and features (columns), respectively. The heatmap was annotated with metadata [metadata_of_interest]. The values were colored by the top percentiles (0.01/0.99) of the data to avoid shifts in the coloring scheme caused by outliers.

**Visualization**
The R-packages ggplot2 (ver) [ref] and patchwork (ver) [ref] were used to generate all 2D visualizations colored by metadata [metadata], feature(s) [features_to_plot], and/or clustering results.
Interactive visualizations in self-contained HTML files of all 2D and 3D projections/embeddings were generated using plotly express (ver) [ref].

**Cluster Analysis**

**Leiden Clustering**
We applied the Leiden algorithm (ver) [ref] to the UMAP KNN graphs specified by the respective parameters (metric, n_neighbors). The adjacency matrix of the KNN graph was converted to a weighted undirected graph using igraph (ver) [ref]. The Leiden algorithm was then applied to this graph, using the specified partition type [partition_types], resolution [resolutions], and number of iterations [n_iterations]. All clustering results were visualized as described above as 2D and interactive 2D and 3D plots for all available embedings/projections.

**Clustification Approach (beta)**
We developed/employed an iterative clustering approach, termed Clustification, that merges clusters based on misclassification. The method was initialized with the clustering result that had the highest resolution (i.e., the most clusters). We then performed iterative classification using the cluster labels, to determine if the classifier can distinguish between clusters or if they should be merged. This involved a stratified 5-fold cross-validation and a Random Forest classifier with default parameters (e.g., 100 trees). The predicted labels were retained for each iteration. Clusters were merged based on a normalized confusion matrix built using the predicted labels. This matrix was made symmetric and upper triangular, resulting in a similarity graph, such that each edge weight ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means that the classifier was able to distinguish all observations between the two respective clusters. The stopping criterion was set such that if the maximum edge weight was less than 2.5% (i.e., 0.025 â€“ less than 5% of observations are misclassified between any two clusters), the process would stop and return the current cluster labels. Otherwise, the two clusters connected by the maximum edge weight were merged. This process was repeated until the stopping criterion was met.

**Clustree Analysis & Visualization**
We performed cluster analysis and visualization using the Clustree package (ver) [ref] with the parameters [count_filter], [prop_filter], and [layout]. The default analysis produced a standard Clustree visualization, ordered by the number of clusters and annotated accordingly. For the custom analysis, we extended the default behaviour by adding [metadata_of_interest] as additional "clusterings". Metadata and features, specified in the configuration, were highlighted on top of the clusterings using aggregation functions. For numerical data, we used the [numerical_aggregation_option] function , and for categorical data, we used the [categorical_label_option] function.

**Cluster Validation - External Indices**
We validated/analyzed the clustering results by comparing them with all categorical metadata using external cluster indices. The complementary indices used were Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) [ref], Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) [ref], Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FMI) [ref], Homogeneity, Completeness, and V-Measure [ref] from scikit-learn (ver) [ref]. The indices were calculated for each clustering result and each categorical metadata, and visualized using hierarchically clustered heatmaps.

**Cluster Validation - Internal Indices & MCDM using TOPSIS**
We performed internal cluster validation using six complementary indices: Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, C-index, Dunn index, Davis-Bouldin Score from the clusterCrit package (ver) [ref], and a weighted Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) approach as described in [Reichl 2018 - Chapter 4.2.2 - Internal Indices](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/3488). To reduce computational cost, PCA results from before were used as input, and only a random sample proportion of [sample_proportion] was used. These internal cluster indices are linear, using Euclidean distance metrics. To rank all clustering results and [metadata_of_interest] from best to worst, we applied the Multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method TOPSIS from the the Python package pymcdm (ver) [ref] to the internal cluster indices, as described in [Reichl 2018 - Chapter 4.3.1 - The Favorite Approach](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/3488).

**The analysis and visualizations described here were performed using a publicly available Snakemake [ver] (ref) workflow [10.5281/zenodo.8405360](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8405360).**

## Cluster Analysis
> _"The validation of clustering structures is the most difficult and frustrating part of cluster analysis. Without a strong effort in this direction, cluster analysis will remain a black art accessible only to those true believers who have experience and great courage."_ from _Algorithms for Clustering Data (1988)_ by Jain & Dubes

            - Merge the two clusters connected by the maximum edge weight.
        4. Back to 2. using the new labels.
- Clustree analysis and visualization

    - default: produces the standard clustree visualization, ordered by number of clusters and annotated.
    - custom: extends default by adding [metadata_of_interest] as additional "clusterings".

    - Internal cluster indices are determined for each clustering and [metadata_of_interest]
        - 6 complementary indices are used
            - 5 from the package [clusterCrit](https://rdrr.io/cran/clusterCrit/man/intCriteria.html): Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, C-index, Dunn index, Davis-Bouldin Score.
            - 1 weighted Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) approach, previously described in [Reichl 2018 - Chapter 4.2.2 - Internal Indices](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/3488) 
        - Due to the comutational cost PCA results are used as input and a [sample_proportion] can be configured.
        - Caveat: internal cluster indices are linear i.e., using Euclidean distance metrics.
    - Multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) using TOPSIS for ranking clustering results
        - The MCDM method TOPSIS is applied to the internal cluster indices to rank all clustering results (and [metadata_of_interest]) from best to worst.
        - This approach has been described in [Reichl 2018 - Chapter 4.3.1 - The Favorite Approach](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/3488)
        - Caveat: Silhouette score sometimes generates NA due to a known [bug](https://github.com/cran/clusterCrit/pull/1/commits/b37a5e361d0a12f9d3900089aa03e3947d0d4ef7). Clusterings with NA scores are removed before TOPSIS is applied.
- Visualization
    - all clustering results as 2D and interactive 2D & 3D plots for all available embedings/projections.
    - external cluster indices as hierarchically clustered heatmaps, aggregated in one panel.
    - internal cluster indices as one heatmap with clusterings (and [metadata_of_interest]) sorted by TOPSIS ranking from top to bottom and split cluster indices split by type (cost/benefit functions to be minimized/maximized).


# Usage
Here are some tips for the usage of this workflow:
- Start with minimal parameter combinations and without UMAP diagnostics and connectivity plots (they are computational expensive and slow).
- Heatmaps require **a lot** of memory, hence options to reduce computational cost are provided and the memory allocation is solved dynamically based on retries. If an out-of-memory exception occurs the flag `--retries X` can be used to trigger automatic resubmission X times upon failure with X times the memory.
- Clustification performance scales with available cores, i.e., more cores faster internal parallelization of Random Forest training & testing.
- Cluster indices are extremely compute intense and scale linearly with every additional clustering result and specified metadata (can be skipped).

# single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis
Unsupervised analyses, dimensionality reduction and cluster analysis, are corner stones of scRNA-seq data analyses.
A full run on a [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0636-z) scRNA-seq [cancer dataset](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/sites/3CA/colorectal) with 21,657 cells and 18,245 genes took 2.5 hours to complete (without heatmaps, with 32GB memory and 8 cores for clustification).
